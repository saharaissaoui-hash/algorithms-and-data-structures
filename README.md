# Pattern-Based Problem Solving

These are my solutions to algorithmic problems, organized by pattern instead of by platform.

I’m structuring them this way to build intuition around recurring ideas (like prefix sums, two pointers, monotonic stacks, etc.) rather than treating each problem as something isolated.

Each file contains:

- Time and space complexity notes

- Explanations of the main idea

- Comments about edge cases

- Trade offs I considered (memory vs clarity, in place vs extra allocation)

- Mistakes I made and what I learned from them

Sometimes you’ll see comments about small implementation details (like Python reference behavior or why a certain formula was wrong at first). I’m keeping those in on purpose, they’re part of the learning process.
